## About Me

Hi there! I'm Abbas Salami, an avid learner and enthusiast in the fields of signal processing, machine learning, and AI. I hold a Ph.D. in computer science, along with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and an M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering. Currently based in the UK, I find the intersection of AI and neuroscience particularly fascinating.

I have a strong passion for cloud computing and I am actively preparing to obtain the AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate. With a knack for quick learning, I have delved into AI and machine learning on my own, continuously expanding my knowledge and skills in these areas. Alongside my own studies, I thoroughly enjoy teaching computer science and sharing my expertise with others.
